<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Create a MongoDB cluster
1. Visit https://mongodb.com and register an account

2. Create a project and a free shared database

3. After creation, click on **Connect** and choose **Connect your application**

4. Make sure **Driver** is set to Node.js

5. Save the URI string, and replace the password with a password of your choice, and replace **myFirstDatabase** with the name you want your database to have

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local files

2. Install npm packages for both the front- and backend. Frontend files are located in the /frontend folder. Backend files are located in the root folder.
```
npm install
```
3. To start the Node server, in the root folder, run:
```
npm run dev
```
4. To start the Vue server, in the frontend folder, run:
```
npm run serve
```
5. In the root folder, if not already created, create a .env file

6. In the .env file, add 3 environment variables:
```
MONGO_URI
JWT_SECRET
PORT

7. Set the **MONGO_URI** to the URI string you recievied from your MongoDB cluster

8. Set **JWT_SECRET** to any string you want, but recommended that it is a longer string, that includes lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
